    <h2>Wed Designer, front-end Developer, and Mentor</h2>
    <p>Since starting my journey it has been a none stop rollercoaster of new skills and challenges to overcome. I have done a fair amount of remote work, collaborated with many very talented individuals, and challenged myself to better my skills.
        I am a very hardworker, always looking to improve/better my coding skills, and enjoy solving new challanges. </p>
